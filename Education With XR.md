The education industry has been allegedly quite slow to embrace new technologies. While
other fields have started climbing up the ladders using technological aids, it feels like
education being the base of predominantly every other sector needs to consider a boost as
well. Technology in the field of education can influence students to learn actively and can
motivate them, leading to an effective process of learning. Some types of research have
recognized the problem that technology in education will lead to a passive learning
process if the technology used does not encourage critical thinking, meaning-making or
metacognition. Working more upon these concerns, a certain kind of technology, namely
XR-a combination of Augmented and Virtual Reality, AR and VR respectively has shown
to have a good perspective in making the learning process more active, understandable and
meaningful. This is primarily because AR works to bring an interactive experience of a
real-world environment and VR works to simulate a completely different interactive
graphical environment. In a nutshell, both these technologies crave to bring us a digital
interactive experience. AR and VR can allow students to practically understand concepts
digitally that cannot be done using traditional methods. For instance, using Microsoft
Hololens, students can build virtual mechanical devices, robots and make them work
without having physical appliances. They can go on a space-trip to understand astronomy
better or swim into the oceans to understand marine-biology more practically. While the
best thing here is this can be done without actually going out of the classroom.
